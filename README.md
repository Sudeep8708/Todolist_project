# Todolist_project
This is a simple TodoList with some pretty good features built-in to serve you ! Do check this out ! Hope you have a well-organised and productive day ahead ! :) 

This is built by using _Vanilla JavaScript, HTML,CSS_ in **Frontend part** and _Node.js along with its framework_ _Express_ for the **Middleware** and **Backend part**.
This is my first FullStack Project. 
Attempted to build this without using any kind of front-end frameworks.

# Features:

-> **Specify a Title** and **Description** for your Task to give you a clear insight of what you do you really want to do.

-> You have **Priorities** to prioritize each and every task.

-> There are **tags to show the priority using different colors** of each and every task.

-> Still Sick of scrolling between to know where the important task is? This has a feature of **Sorting the List using Priorities (High to Low)**.

-> You can **Edit** the Title, Description, Priority of every task.
